# porfolio-login-swift - Sample Login App in Swift
Essentially this is a swift version of the repository <a href="https://github.com/wir349/porfolio-login">here: </a>

Right now the architecture is the same as the objective-C version but I eventually plan to diverge the two as per SWIFT requirements.

A couple of the files I haven't ported over but that I'll do in due time.

<b>Functionality</b>

In terms of functionality this app is REALLY simple. All it does is mimick a login functionality <b>W/O</b> a real api. No matter which email/password combination you put it'll allow you to login


And Swift is AWESOME.
